// introduced in ES6
// let 
// const
// var already existed

// let allows variables to change later
// mutation is possible with let
// empty variables can be decleared with let
let age = 30;
age = 31;

// const is a constant variable
// not supposed to change
const birthYear = 1991;
// this is not possible
// birthYear = 1992;

// need an additional value to be able to use const
// const job;

// use const by default and let when you need to change
// good practice to have as little variable change as possible

// var should be avoided
// var is function scoped
